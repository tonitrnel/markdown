## Highlighting (extension)

OFM enables the `highlighting` extension. Text wrapped in two equal signs (`==`)
is rendered as highlighted text.

```````````````````````````````` example
==highlight==
.
<p><mark>highlight</mark></p>
````````````````````````````````

Highlighting can be used inline:

```````````````````````````````` example
Use two equal signs to ==highlight text==.
.
<p>Use two equal signs to <mark>highlight text</mark>.</p>
````````````````````````````````

Multiple highlights in one line:

```````````````````````````````` example
==first== and ==second== highlights.
.
<p><mark>first</mark> and <mark>second</mark> highlights.</p>
````````````````````````````````

Highlighting can contain bold:

```````````````````````````````` example
==**bold highlight**==
.
<p><mark><strong>bold highlight</strong></mark></p>
````````````````````````````````

Highlighting can contain italic:

```````````````````````````````` example
==*italic highlight*==
.
<p><mark><em>italic highlight</em></mark></p>
````````````````````````````````

A single equal sign does not create a highlight:

```````````````````````````````` example
=not highlighted=
.
<p>=not highlighted=</p>
````````````````````````````````

Three or more equal signs do not create a highlight:

```````````````````````````````` example
===not highlighted===
.
<p>===not highlighted===</p>
````````````````````````````````

Unclosed highlight markers are treated as plain text:

```````````````````````````````` example
==not closed
.
<p>==not closed</p>
````````````````````````````````

Highlight cannot span multiple paragraphs:

```````````````````````````````` example
==not

highlighted==
.
<p>==not</p>
<p>highlighted==</p>
````````````````````````````````
