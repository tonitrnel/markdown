## Embeds (extension)

OFM enables the `embed` extension. An exclamation mark before double brackets
(`![[]]`) embeds the content of another file.

Embed a note:

```````````````````````````````` example
![[My Note]]
.
<p><span class="internal-embed" src="My Note"></span></p>
````````````````````````````````

Embed a heading section:

```````````````````````````````` example
![[My Note#Heading 2]]
.
<p><span class="internal-embed" src="My Note#Heading 2"></span></p>
````````````````````````````````

Embed a block:

```````````````````````````````` example
![[My Note#^block-id]]
.
<p><span class="internal-embed" src="My Note#^block-id"></span></p>
````````````````````````````````

Embed an image:

```````````````````````````````` example
![[photo.jpg]]
.
<p><img src="photo.jpg" alt="photo.jpg" /></p>
````````````````````````````````

Embed an image with width:

```````````````````````````````` example
![[photo.jpg|200]]
.
<p><img src="photo.jpg" alt="photo.jpg" width="200" /></p>
````````````````````````````````

Embed an image with width and height:

```````````````````````````````` example
![[photo.jpg|200x300]]
.
<p><img src="photo.jpg" alt="photo.jpg" width="200" height="300" /></p>
````````````````````````````````

Embed inline with text:

```````````````````````````````` example
Here is ![[photo.jpg]] an image.
.
<p>Here is <img src="photo.jpg" alt="photo.jpg" /> an image.</p>
````````````````````````````````
