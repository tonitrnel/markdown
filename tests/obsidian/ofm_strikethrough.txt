## Strikethrough (extension)

Text wrapped in two tildes (`~~`) is rendered as strikethrough.

```````````````````````````````` example
~~strikethrough~~
.
<p><del>strikethrough</del></p>
````````````````````````````````

Inline strikethrough:

```````````````````````````````` example
Any word wrapped with two tildes (like ~~this~~) will appear crossed out.
.
<p>Any word wrapped with two tildes (like <del>this</del>) will appear crossed out.</p>
````````````````````````````````

Single tilde also works in OFM:

```````````````````````````````` example
~single tilde~ strikethrough.
.
<p><del>single tilde</del> strikethrough.</p>
````````````````````````````````

Strikethrough with inline formatting:

```````````````````````````````` example
~~**bold and deleted**~~
.
<p><del><strong>bold and deleted</strong></del></p>
````````````````````````````````

Strikethrough cannot span multiple paragraphs:

```````````````````````````````` example
~~not

crossed~~
.
<p>~~not</p>
<p>crossed~~</p>
````````````````````````````````

Three or more tildes do not create a strikethrough:

```````````````````````````````` example
~~~not strikethrough~~~
.
<p>~~~not strikethrough~~~</p>
````````````````````````````````

Multiple strikethroughs in one line:

```````````````````````````````` example
~~first~~ and ~~second~~ deleted.
.
<p><del>first</del> and <del>second</del> deleted.</p>
````````````````````````````````
