## Block Identifiers (extension)

OFM enables the `block identifier` extension. A caret followed by an identifier
(`^block-id`) at the end of a block defines a referenceable block.

Block id at the end of a paragraph:

```````````````````````````````` example
This is a paragraph.
^my-block-id
.
<p id="my-block-id">This is a paragraph.</p>
````````````````````````````````

Block id with alphanumeric characters:

```````````````````````````````` example
Some content here.
^abc123
.
<p id="abc123">Some content here.</p>
````````````````````````````````

Standalone block id on its own line:

```````````````````````````````` example
A paragraph above.

^standalone-id
.
<p>A paragraph above.</p>
<p id="standalone-id"></p>
````````````````````````````````
