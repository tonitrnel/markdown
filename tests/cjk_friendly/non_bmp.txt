// Non-BMP character emphasis tests
// These characters (mathematical symbols, Avestan script) are NOT CJK,
// so standard CommonMark delimiter rules apply — emphasis should NOT open/close
// when flanked by non-CJK non-punctuation non-whitespace on both sides.

## CJK Non-BMP: Non-CJK symbols should not trigger CJK rules
