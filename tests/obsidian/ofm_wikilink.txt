## Internal Links (extension)

OFM enables the `wikilink` extension. Double brackets (`[[]]`) create internal
links to other notes.

Basic wikilink:

```````````````````````````````` example
[[My Note]]
.
<p><a href="My Note" class="internal-link">My Note</a></p>
````````````````````````````````

Wikilink with custom display text using pipe:

```````````````````````````````` example
[[My Note|custom text]]
.
<p><a href="My Note" class="internal-link">custom text</a></p>
````````````````````````````````

Wikilink to a heading:

```````````````````````````````` example
[[My Note#Heading 2]]
.
<p><a href="My Note#Heading 2" class="internal-link">My Note &gt; Heading 2</a></p>
````````````````````````````````

Wikilink to a block:

```````````````````````````````` example
[[My Note#^block-id]]
.
<p><a href="My Note#^block-id" class="internal-link">My Note</a></p>
````````````````````````````````

Wikilink to heading with custom display text:

```````````````````````````````` example
[[My Note#Heading|display]]
.
<p><a href="My Note#Heading" class="internal-link">display</a></p>
````````````````````````````````

Wikilink inline with other text:

```````````````````````````````` example
See [[My Note]] for details.
.
<p>See <a href="My Note" class="internal-link">My Note</a> for details.</p>
````````````````````````````````

Multiple wikilinks in one line:

```````````````````````````````` example
Link to [[Note A]] and [[Note B]].
.
<p>Link to <a href="Note A" class="internal-link">Note A</a> and <a href="Note B" class="internal-link">Note B</a>.</p>
````````````````````````````````

Empty wikilink is not valid:

```````````````````````````````` example
[[]]
.
<p>[[]]</p>
````````````````````````````````
