## Comments (extension)

OFM enables the `comment` extension. Text wrapped in double percent signs (`%%`)
is hidden from the rendered output.

Inline comments are stripped:

```````````````````````````````` example
This is an %%inline%% comment.
.
<p>This is an  comment.</p>
````````````````````````````````

Multiple inline comments in one line:

```````````````````````````````` example
Hello %%hidden1%% world %%hidden2%% end.
.
<p>Hello  world  end.</p>
````````````````````````````````

Comment at the beginning of a line:

```````````````````````````````` example
%%hidden%%visible text
.
<p>visible text</p>
````````````````````````````````

Comment at the end of a line:

```````````````````````````````` example
visible text%%hidden%%
.
<p>visible text</p>
````````````````````````````````

Unclosed double percent is not treated as a comment:

```````````````````````````````` example
This is %%not a comment
.
<p>This is %%not a comment</p>
````````````````````````````````
