## Callouts (extension)

OFM enables the `callout` extension. A blockquote whose first line matches
`> [!type]` is rendered as a callout.

Basic note callout:

```````````````````````````````` example
> [!note]
> This is a note callout.
.
<div class="callout" data-callout="note">
<div class="callout-title">Note</div>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>This is a note callout.</p>
</div>
</div>
````````````````````````````````

Callout with custom title:

```````````````````````````````` example
> [!tip] Hot tip
> This is a tip with a custom title.
.
<div class="callout" data-callout="tip">
<div class="callout-title">Hot tip</div>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>This is a tip with a custom title.</p>
</div>
</div>
````````````````````````````````

Callout with markdown content:

```````````````````````````````` example
> [!info]
> Supports **bold** and *italic*.
.
<div class="callout" data-callout="info">
<div class="callout-title">Info</div>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Supports <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italic</em>.</p>
</div>
</div>
````````````````````````````````

Foldable callout (collapsed by default):

```````````````````````````````` example
> [!warning]-
> This is collapsed by default.
.
<div class="callout is-collapsible is-collapsed" data-callout="warning">
<div class="callout-title">Warning</div>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>This is collapsed by default.</p>
</div>
</div>
````````````````````````````````

Foldable callout (expanded by default):

```````````````````````````````` example
> [!warning]+
> This is expanded by default.
.
<div class="callout is-collapsible" data-callout="warning">
<div class="callout-title">Warning</div>

<p>This is expanded by default.</p>
</div>
</div>
